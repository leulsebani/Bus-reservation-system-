# Bus-reservation-system-
INTRIDUCTION\

This project is done by using C++ program.As we know it can be done in detailed way with more features but as the instruction given to us we tried to be in the circle of topics which we learn as much as we can.
in general the programme accepts information from the user to reserve a place for the trip.

How it works

The program begins with the preprocessor directive #include <iostream>, which allows the use of input and output operations through the standard I/O stream.
The const char* data type is used to allocate space for character arrays, typically for handling strings such as usernames or passwords.
The main function starts with the registration section. Two Boolean variables, login and userMatch, are utilized to manage the login and user verification process.
After the login process, an int choice variable is used to allow the user to select one of three main actions: making a reservation, viewing information, or exiting the system.
A switch statement handles the choice input:
Case 1: Reservation – The user is prompted to select a starting point and destination. If the user confirms their selection, they proceed to choose a seat number, travel date, and time. If not confirmed, the system loops back to repeat the process.
Case 2: Information – Displays relevant system or user information.
Case 3: Exit – Terminates the program and exits the system.
